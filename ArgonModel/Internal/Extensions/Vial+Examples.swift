Using ArgonPro you will be able to easily create advanced static websites from your iPad or iPhone.

To edit this page, simple tap the "Homepage.md" item under the "Pages" title in the main view of your Vial.

You will notice that although the filename is "Homepage.md", this page was rendered to a file name "index.html". That's because in the front matter of the file, the key-pair "slug: /index.html" is present. This overrides the automatic filename conversion into slugs.
